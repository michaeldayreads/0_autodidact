## A place for the code, distinct from the words.

These are exercises, experiments, and entertainments produced in an effort to teach myself - slowly - to code.

_Compassionate comments, suggestions and feedback welcome - please open an issue._

## Conventions

Much of the code in this repo is from tutorials of one form or another. Patterns in tutorials are often of the form:

* basic example
* refined example
* further refined example
* etc...

Or of the form:

* concrete example 1
* concrete example 2
* abstract example covering both use 1 and 2

I find it useful to keep these side by side, either in one file with earlier iterations commented out, or in versions of files. When using the latter convention, the file name will be amended and referred to as follows:

```
example.py      # null version
example0.py     # version 0
example1.py     # version 1 etc.
```

### A note on licensing

All exercise sources are cited. Efforts are made to point to known licenses in any code provided as the base of an exercise and then modified. If I have made an error in these attributions, please notify me how to correct it and I will.

Materials from a course, video, book or other media access was free and open, purchased or otherwise granted lawfully, i.e. a library or similar institution.

If you are the author of posted exercises and would prefer my solutions are not posted, please contact me.  

All code not attributed to another author is covered by the GPL 2.0 license, in the sense that if I have an interesting way of approaching a problem (well executed or not) and you build on that approach or idea, please make that work available to all.
